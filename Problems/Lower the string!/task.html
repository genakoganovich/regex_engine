<h2>Lower the string!</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>There's a function called <code class="java">string_to_lower()</code>. We can't see its code, but we know exactly how it works: given a string, it converts it to lowercase. If the input is not a string, a <code class="java">ValueError</code> exception is raised inside the function. You need to check that the code works correctly when the input is not a string.</p> 
  <p>In this problem, you don't need to import the module with the function in the beginning of the code. To call the function, just type its name, <code class="java">string_to_lower().</code></p>
