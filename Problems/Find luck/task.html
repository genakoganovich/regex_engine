<h2>Find luck</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
   There's a function called 
  <code class="java">find_luck()</code>. We can't see its code, but we know exactly how it works: given a string, it returns an object if 'luck' is contained in the string, and 
  <code class="java">None</code> otherwise. Write tests for this function (use 
  <code class="java">assertIsNotNone</code> and 
  <code class="java">assertIsNone</code>).
  <p></p> 
  <p>In this problem, you don't need to import the module with the function in the beginning of the code. To call the function, just type its name, <code class="java">find_luck()</code>.</p>
